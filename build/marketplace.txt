This app allows you to edit metadata in audio files. This includes the title, artist and album shown in the music app as well as the cover image.

Please note the following things:
<ul>
<li>This app is very much beta, and will have some rough edges.</li>
<li>This app only works with MP3 and OGG/Vorbis files.</li>
<li>You can only edit the metadata the music app cares about. You can keep other metadata, though.</li>
<li>The track and disc number should be pure numeric, optionally followed by a slash and the total number. You won't be prevented from entering anything else, though.</li>
<li>You can add cover images to OGG files, but only recent versions of Firefox OS will read them (probably, I didn't actually test this). Also note that large images will break the file. The threshold is somewhere around 100 KB.</li>
<li>The original file is kept unchanged, instead a new copy will be stored in your Download folder. Please make sure that this new file works as expected before replacing the original.</li>
<li>This app is free software, its source can be obtained on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Schnark/musicmetadata">Github</a>. There you also find the exact conditions under which you are allowed to reuse this software. This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty.</li>
